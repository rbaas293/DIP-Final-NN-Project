### Directory Overview `root/code/_training/current_test_data`

* `../` - Location for image files we are using to test/train our NN.

#### Why have this directory?

a constant directory to have our script pointing to. This way we dont have to go in and change code. all we need to do is clean this directory
and copy another set from `root/code/imagenet/<set-name>` over to here (`root/code/current_test_data`)
